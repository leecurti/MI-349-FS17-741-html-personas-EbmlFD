    <h3>Short Pitch</h3>
    <p>SpaceUmbrella is a company that believes in life beyond Earth. We leave our galaxy in order to find life.</p>
    <h3>Long Pitch</h3>
    <p>With all the Myths from different civilizations, we came to a proposal that all of those myths may have been real. Even though people do not see anything like that anymore, it is possible that those creatures from the myths are creatures that came to Earth from another planet outside our galaxy. That could either mean that the creatures are life with incredible intelligence so that they can build long distance spaceships or that those are only non-intelligent life that was sent up into space by creatures that are intelligent. Either way, they both support the proposal that their is life beyond Earth. </p>
